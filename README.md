# CS120A

Overview EE/CS120A introduces you to the exciting world of digital design. Digital circuits not only form the foundation of computers, but make possible many of the advances around us, like cell phones, video games, medical instruments, automotive systems, satellites, music equipment, military equipment, store automation. You name it -- if it runs on electricity, it's probably got digital circuits (known as embedded systems) inside! 120A gets you up to speed on the basics; the follow-up course, 120B, teaches you to build a computer, and to build complete working embedded computing systems. Finally, you can put your knowledge of digital design to use in EE/CS 168 where you learn the design process of creating Integrated Circuits from a digital design.

Using Xilinx and a Spartan FPGA for designing hardware code.
